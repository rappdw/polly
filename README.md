# A Very Simple Implementation of Polly
So, I awoke this morning after a couple days battling a cold, and had lost my voice. 

This proved to be very difficult in our stand-up meeting, as the video conferencing software we
use, keys off of someone speaking. I tried Slack (actually we use HipChat, but I wish we used Slack), but
found that the other team members weren't monitoring it sufficiently for me to participate 
in standup as I'd hoped.

AWS Polly to the rescue. If I still don't have my voice tomorrow, at least I'll have a voice in
the meeting. :)
